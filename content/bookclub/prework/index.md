## The Start of Something New

The initial get together to start this reading group came from Yun-te, Sanchita and I talking about some book that we loved, what we'd been reading recently and what books we were interested in... This all concluded in the inevitable question: 

> *Should we start a Book Club?* 
>
> <cite class="f6 i">― Someone</cite>

Which, surprisingly came back with a resoundingly positive response (and some sighing from Sanchita, which we promptly ignored). Thus we moved to scouring our friend groups to see who would be willing participants and read with us, adding Menita and Manu to the group. We also started the typical over-organizing with productivity apps and reading lists to most **efficiently have fun**.

After we met we thought it would be a good idea to write something with the opinions of th lovely people that are joining. Generally speaking they have great opinions and it would have been a real waste to see them go to waste. Also, this may just be a cautionary tale for those who are looking to start their own book club... see what works and don't do like us. 

Thanks for joining us :smile:.
